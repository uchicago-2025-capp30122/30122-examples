        "In the past few decades modern computers have gotten *exponentially* more efficient at working with numerical data, a side effect of the dmeands of modern graphics.\n",
        "Libraries like `NumPy` and `polars` can take advantage of these optimizations, and libraries like `pandas` and `shapely` can benefit.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in many domains, a surprising amount of time is spent manipulating strings:\n",
        "consider how fundamental HTTP is, comparing strings, cleaning them, extracting information from a larger string.\n",
        "\n",
        "While modern computers have gotten faster (able to perform more tasks per second) this has mostly been a *linear* improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenge in part stems from the fact that unlike math, where we can parallelize a lot of operations, string manipulation is inheriently sequential. It often involves iterating over something one character at a time, limiting our ability to optimize.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, strings are *immutable*.\n",
        "Functions do not modify strings, they must return a new string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's what a simplified implementation of `str.replace` that can only replace a single character might look like:\n",

        "def replace_one_char(self, from_ch, to_ch):\n",

        "\n",
        "While the actual implementation would be in C, the algorithm itself can't really be more efficient than this.\n",
